# AfriFarms (KswHub Hackathon)

# Demo https://openfarm-db746.firebaseapp.com/

Developed as one of the submissions for the hackathon hosted by the Ken Saro-Wiwa innovative hub, AfriFarms is a platform that hosts educational content for Farmers, allows farmers to see funding opportunities, and for registered users to apply to those funding opportunities. Farmers can be found by searching a particular produce or by name. Investors can find farmers, and their products, and post funding opportunities. Farmers can upload their farm produce for sale to the general public.
